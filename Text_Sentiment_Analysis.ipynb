    "# 🎬 IMDB Sentiment Analysis – Project Overview & Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "This project focuses on building a sentiment analysis model using the IMDB Movie Reviews dataset. The goal is to classify reviews as either positive or negative using traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a machine learning algorithm (Logistic Regression).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📥 1. Dataset Loading\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by loading the IMDB dataset which contains 50,000 labeled movie reviews — 25,000 positive and 25,000 negative. Each review is paired with a sentiment label, making this a supervised binary classification problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧹 2. Data Inspection & Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "Before preprocessing, we examine the dataset for missing values or inconsistencies. Fortunately, the dataset is clean and free from null values, which means we can proceed directly to text processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔄 3. Label Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "The sentiment column contains string values: \"positive\" or \"negative\". These are mapped to numeric values:\n",
    "- Positive → 1  \n",
    "- Negative → 0\n",
    "\n",
    "This numerical format is required for model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧽 4. Text Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "We apply several preprocessing steps using NLTK to clean the review texts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Convert all text to lowercase  \n",
    "- Tokenize the text into words  \n",
    "- Remove punctuation and non-alphabetic tokens  \n",
    "- Remove stopwords (commonly used but uninformative words)  \n",
    "- Apply lemmatization to reduce words to their base form  \n",
    "\n",
    "This results in a clean, normalized version of each review suitable for vectorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 5. Feature Extraction with TF-IDF\n",
    "\n",
    "The cleaned review texts are transformed into numerical features using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency). This technique helps represent the importance of each word in a review relative to the whole dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We limit the feature size to 5,000 most important words to reduce complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🤖 6. Model Building – Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "We split the data into training and testing sets (80/20 split). Then we train a Logistic Regression model on the training data. This model is widely used for binary classification tasks due to its simplicity and effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 7. Model Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "The trained model is evaluated on the test set using:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accuracy score  \n",
    "- Precision, recall, and F1-score (via classification report)\n",
    "\n",
    "The results indicate strong model performance, proving that traditional NLP techniques combined with logistic regression can be powerful for sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧪 8. Custom Review Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "We add functionality to predict the sentiment of any custom movie review provided by the user. The input is cleaned, transformed using the TF-IDF vectorizer, and passed through the trained model to generate a prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📌 Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "- The model effectively classifies sentiments using traditional machine learning methods.  \n",
    "- TF-IDF combined with basic text preprocessing captures enough semantic meaning to distinguish between positive and negative reviews.  \n",
    "- This project can be extended by experimenting with more advanced models (e.g., SVM, Naive Bayes, or LSTM), incorporating n-grams, or visualizing the most important words using word clouds.\n",
