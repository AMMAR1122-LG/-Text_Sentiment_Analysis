> A streamlined, scalable solution for understanding emotional tone in textual data.

**Sentivault** is an end-to-end machine learning pipeline built for sentiment classification. With a clean and modular structure, it walks through the stages of data cleaning, TF-IDF vectorization, model training, and prediction. This project is beginner-friendly but also flexible enough for experimentation and scalability.

## 🔍 Project Objective

To build a sentiment analysis model that classifies input text into one of three categories:
- **Positive**
- **Negative**
- **Neutral**

This notebook demonstrates best practices in preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation with interpretable metrics.
